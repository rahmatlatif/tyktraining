Workshop 4 - Retrieving Logs, configuration files and logging 

CloudFormation Ubuntu

*Assuming you have already SSH into the EC2 instance*

******Configuration Files*********
Configuration files are stored in /opt/{name-of-tyk-component}/{nameofcomponent}.conf

Use a text editor to make changes to the configuration. 
Refer to below documentation for configuration value descriptions

******Retrieving Logs********
Logs are captured in /var/log/syslog

Use sudo grep "tyk" /var/log/syslog to filter Tyk related logs
Use sudo grep "tyk" /var/log/syslog | sudo tee /var/log/tyk_logs.txt to export to a text file
sudo grep "tyk" /var/log/syslog | sudo tee -a /var/log/tyk_logs.txt to append new log lines to existing text file

********Setting Logging Verbosity**********

By default, logging verbosity is "info"

For Gateway, set "log_level": "debug"

For all other components:

Find service file
sudo find /etc/systemd/system/ -name "tyk-dashboard.service"

Edit service file
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/tyk-dashboard.service

Set in [Service] section
Environment="TYK_LOGLEVEL=debug"

Reload daemon
sudo systemctl daemon-reload

Restart Tyk component
sudo systemctl restart tyk-dashboard

Notes:
Dashboard: tyk-dashboard
Pump: tyk-pump
MDCB: tyk-sink
